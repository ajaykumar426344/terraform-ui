Terraform UI 🌐

Terraform UI is a lightweight web-based interface built with Flask and Terraform to simplify infrastructure provisioning.
Instead of using the Terraform CLI directly, users can create, apply, and destroy AWS infrastructure through an intuitive UI.

✨ Features

🔄 Dynamic AWS Lookups
Fetch AWS resources (Regions, VPCs, Subnets, CIDR ranges) dynamically using boto3.

🖥️ Instance Configuration
Select Instance type, OS type, Private IP, and Region easily.

⚡ Terraform Integration

Auto-generates terraform.tfvars from UI input

Runs terraform plan & terraform apply

Supports destroy with one click

📊 Status Page
Monitor real-time progress and logs of infrastructure deployments.

🐳 Dockerized Runtime

Plugin cache enabled to fix provider exec/noexec issues

Environment isolated for consistency

🔒 IAM Role Support
Uses instance roles for secure AWS API calls.
